      | Welcome! We're a collective of student volunteers who maintain digital services for the
      | students, staff, and alumni of #[a(href='https://swarthmore.edu') Swarthmore College]. We
      | offer club mailing lists, a campus directory, a daily digest, and much more. Most services
      | require an SCCS account, available to anyone with an @swarthmore.edu email address.
