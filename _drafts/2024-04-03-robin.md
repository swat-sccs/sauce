SCCS hosts a public, high-resource, student-administrated server VM for the Swarthmore community to use. The current VM, `robin`, runs Fedora Server and can be accessed via SSH at `robin.sccs.swarthmore.edu`. However, we have also recently opened Web access via Cockpit, allowing users to use a terminal and view stats without needing an SSH client. Head to [the site](https://robin.sccs.swarthmore.edu/) to try it out!
