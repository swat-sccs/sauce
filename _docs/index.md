title: 'About SCCS'
---

We're the Swarthmore College Computer Society, or **SCCS** for short: a student-run group offering
computing services, tools, toys, and information to the Swarthmore College community. Our goal is
not to mirror ITS, but to complement and supplement widely available services by providing resources
that would otherwise be out of the reach of individuals. For our part, **SCCS Staff** learn extremely
practical system administration and software development skills&mdash;the stuff you can't learn in a
CS lecture.

## Who We Are

**SCCS** is run entirely by student volunteers. We're not affiliated with Swarthmore ITS nor the
Computer Science department (although our staff are sometimes CS majors, for obvious reasons). We
accept new members in the first few weeks of each semester.

### Statement on Application Strategy
SCCS has a semesterly application cycle. We interview, select, and purge staff members based
purely on experience, interest, activity, and occasionally interpersonal relationships. We
include the following statement on our application form describing this policy:

SCCS does not discriminate based on any attributes, protected or otherwise, with the only
exceptions being CS skill/knowledge and interpersonal conflicts. However, we recognize that
studies show some protected groups are disproportionately unlikely to complete applications if
they feel they may not be qualified. We would like to emphasize: **You lose nothing by applying**.
Worst-case scenario, you can reapply next semester, and we give application priority to
reapplicants. We've admitted people who got every coding question wrong and people who had to
reapply multiple times, and often these are some of our most active members. We want you to
apply, even if you are afraid you don't have the experience. 

Our one hard requirement is you must **have taken**, **be enrolled in**, or **have equivalent**
**experience** to a 30-level CS course. This is purely to ensure you've worked with **at least**
**one "curly brace" language** (i.e. C, Java, JS, etc., NOT Python) so we don't have to start
from scratch teaching for our work in JavaScript. We do "hiring" cycles semesterly so if you got
lotteried out or otherwise need more experience, it won't be long before you can apply again.
