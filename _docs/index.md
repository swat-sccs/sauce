title: 'About SCCS'
---

We're the Swarthmore College Computer Society, or **SCCS** for short: a student-run group offering
computing services, tools, toys, and information to the Swarthmore College community. Our goal is
not to mirror ITS, but to complement and supplement widely available services by providing resources
that would otherwise be out of the reach of individuals. For our part, **SCCS Staff** learn extremely
practical system administration and software development skills&mdash;the stuff you can't learn in a
CS lecture.

### History

SCCS was founded in Fall 1991 by a group of Swarthmore students, who obtained an official charter
from the Budget Committee for the Spring 1992 semester. We were founded, in part, to support the
activities of students in Dana and Hallowell who had decided to create an Appletalk network by
stringing phone cable between rooms. Approximately 32 Macintoshes on 4 floors (3 in Hallowell, 1 in
Dana) were on the network, as was one heavy-duty laser printer&mdash;two years before the College
network came into being. Gobs of time were spent diagnosing the many network outages that occurred
on an almost-daily basis (usually due to cables being clamped by window frames). 30 years later,
we're no longer stringing phone cable through dorms, but we're still having fun and providing useful
facilities and services for our fellow students.
