Swarthmore is a small place: you trust that we're not going to be evil, and we trust you to use our services responsibly. [Our staff](/docs#current-members) are Swatties too; you have class with us,
you'll see us in the dining hall, and so on. We hope that we're never going to have to refer to this, but just to spell it out:


## Usage Policy
- Don't try to hack us or compromise our services, and don't maliciously overload our systems. If you do find a security vulnerability, please report it to us ASAP.
- Don't use any of our services to do things that are (in our sole opinion) harmful, illegal, hateful, or gratuitously obscene.
- In general, we reserve the right to restrict access, take down content, access data, or do anything else we think is necessary to prevent harm to ourselves or others or to keep our services running smoothly.

## Privacy and Data
- We store information that you give us, because we need it to actually make the service work. (For example, when you give us your email address, we store it so we know where to send you emails.)
- We log some technical info (like your IP address and what browser you're using) to diagnose potential issues, block spam, and so on.
- If you ask us, we'll make an effort to scrub any or all data we have that's associated with you from our servers.
- Some of our services (including Scheduler and Cygnet) pull from databases run by Swarthmore ITS. We don't control these databases, and are not responsible for any inaccuracies. We'll prevent your name and info from being shown on Cygnet if you ask, but it will remain in ITS's directory unless you ask them to delete it.
- We use a self-hosted instance of Plausible Analytics. This lets us see, in aggregate, how many unique visitors our sites get, what pages they visit, and what kinds of devices they use. This data is stored on our servers, isn't shared with anyone outside of SCCS, and doesn't let us track individual users. You can read more [here](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).
- **We don't make any liability or warranty guarantees whatsoever.** We try our best to keep things running and keep data intact, but we might go down, lose data, or be hacked by malicious actors. We incorporate as much of current information security and reliability best practices as we can, particularly for services exposed to the internet, but we are much less robust than real companies with experienced full-time engineers. **Don't use our services to store sensitive personal data, and don't trust us with the only copy of irreplaceable data.** If you do, it's entirely at your own (considerable) risk.
