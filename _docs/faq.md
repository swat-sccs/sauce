#### How do I change my Cygnet profile?

Just email [staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu](mailto:staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu). We can change your
picture, hide your picture or room number, or remove you entirely. Note that we (currently) can't
change your name on the Cygnet, as for legal reasons we don't maintain the student database that
Cygnet uses. If you'd like to change your name, you'll need to contact ITS or the registrar.

#### I'm reviving an old club. Can I have access to their mailing list?

If all the listed owners of the mailing list have graduated, then yes&mdash;just send us an email
and we'll transfer ownership to you.

#### I forgot my SCCS password. How can I reset it?

You can reset your password [here](/account/forgot).

#### How do I join SCCS?

We accept applications for new members every fall. Keep an eye out for an email from us and/or an
announcement on our homepage.

#### I have a cool project idea. Can I work on it with SCCS?

Yes! We are always interested in not only augmenting our old services, but also adding new ones.
Email us and we'd love to hear about it.
