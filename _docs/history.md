**SCCS** has been around for decades&mdash;and we have the cruft to show for it. Across many years of
server migrations, drive recoveries, and more. Learn more about the club's history and about
Swarthmore itself here! More to come.

## SCCS History

The Swarthmore College Computer Society (**SCCS**) was founded in Fall 1991 by a group of Swarthmore
students, who obtained an official charter from the Student Budget Committee for the Spring 1992
semester. We were founded, in part, to support the activities of students in Dana and Hallowell who
had decided to create an AppleTalk network by stringing phone cable between rooms. Approximately 32
Macintoshes on 4 floors (3 in Hallowell, 1 in Dana) were on the network, as was one heavy-duty laser
printer&mdash;two years before the College network came into being. Gobs of time were spent diagnosing
the many network outages that occurred on an almost-daily basis (usually due to cables being clamped
by window frames).

In the more than 30 years since, we've swapped buildings, upgraded our hardware, and expanded our
Staff. We're no longer stringing phone cable through dorms, but we're still having fun and providing
useful facilities and services for our fellow students. Check us out in Clothier basement!

## Swarthmore History

**SCCS** hosts a large collection of historical and archival sites created by former students. A few
highlights:

- [swat history](https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/03/dbing/history/buildings.html)
  This site includes old building info and pictures from an '03 alumnus. Really cool info on here
  about ML, old gymnasiums, and various other buildings.
- [Free Culture Swarthmore](https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/scdc/history.html)
  FCS (and the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons, site no longer available) hosted the
  [Diebold memos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions#Leaked_memos) in a somewhat
  famous incident resulting in school-wide uprising to defend against DMCA and cease & desist attacks.
- [Book and Key History](https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/98/elizw/Swat.history/Book.and.Key.html)
  Did you know Swarthmore had a secret society? Not so secret anymore, however, and this Class of '98
  student expands upon the history of the now-defunct (or are they?) Society of the Book and Key.
