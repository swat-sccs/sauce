    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>
      Someone (probably you) has requested a password reset or username reminder for your account.
      If you didn't request a password reset, you can safely disregard this email, and the link will
      expire in one hour.
    </p>
    <p>Your account username is: <strong>${username}</strong></p>
    <p>You can log in with your current password <a href="${domain}/login">here</a>.</p>
    <p>
      To reset your password, <a href="${domain}/account/reset?id=${resetId}&key=${resetKey}">click here</a>. Or, copy
      and paste this link into your browser:
    </p>
    <p>${domain}/account/reset?id=${resetId}&key=${resetKey}</p>
    <p>
      This link will stay active for one hour; after that, you'll have to
      <a href="${domain}/account/forgot">request a new link</a>. If you have any questions, feel
      free to contact us at
      <a href="mailto:staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu">staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu</a>.
