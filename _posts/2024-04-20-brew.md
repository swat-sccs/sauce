title: "Linuxbrew Fixed on Robin"

`robin` and its predecssors have had Linuxbrew, the Linux version of the popular Mac package manager `brew`, set up for manu years. This is a powerful tool because it allows non-admin users to install packages themselves. Recently we discovered an issue where packages could not be updated or installed in some contexts but we are happy to report it should be fixed now. For documentation, see [the Homebrew site](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux).
