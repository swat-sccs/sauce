The [SCCS Course Planner](https://schedule.sccs.swarthmore.edu/) has been updated for Spring 2025 classes! We would also like to announce that Scheduler v2 is on the way, and should be in beta in the next couple weeks. This 
major update will include plan syncing with your SCCS account, a much more robust planning system, a cleaner and more responsive UI, and more! Keep an eye out for an announcement soon regarding its availability.
