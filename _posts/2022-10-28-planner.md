The [SCCS Course Planner](https://schedule.sccs.swarthmore.edu) has just been updated for Spring 2023! You can use it to search for classes, organize your schedule, and share with your friends. Finally, due to popular demand, we've re-added the calendar export feature after a Google policy update broke it for last semester. As always, feel free to [email us](mailto:staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu) if you have any questions.
