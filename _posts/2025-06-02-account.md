title: "Important Changes to Accounts"

We have enabled a slew of new features across account creation, management, and login to enhance your experience and make life easier. Firstly, 
emails (`email`) are now separate from the unchangeable `swatmail`, and are changeable from our [Account 
Options](https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/account) page. You can set a personal email for SCCS services&mdash;great for alums. We have also enabled the Forgot Password flow directly from our 
SSO login page&mdash;so when you go to log in, you can reset inline without leaving. We have also enabled (in beta) [self-service full account management](https://auth.sccs.swarthmore.edu/realms/master/account). Please 
pardon the unthemed appearance for now--we're working on it!
