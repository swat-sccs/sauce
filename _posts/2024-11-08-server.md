Our production server and VM host, `nest`, has been upgraded with more RAM! We are now running with ~500 GiB total, enabling us to 
have faster and more reliable experiences across the board, and add new VMs to support future projects. As always, you can make use 
of our hardware by SSH'ing into `ssh.sccs.swarthmore.edu` or requesting specific resources.
