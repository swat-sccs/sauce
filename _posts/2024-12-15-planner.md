At long last, the next-generation version of the SCCS Course Planner has released! The Planner now features SCCS Account login and plan sync to make your life easier, a professor and class rating system, and an all-new responsive, modern UI. Planner v2 also uses our new `swatscraper` class schedule scraping tool, which pulls directly from Banner for super fast updates and more accurate course listings. Give it a try at [plan.sccs.swarthmore.edu](https://plan.sccs.swarthmore.edu/).
