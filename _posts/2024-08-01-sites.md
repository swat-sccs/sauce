[SCCS Sites](https://sites.sccs.swarthmore.edu/) is our self-hosted Wordpress service that enables students with no CS experience to design and deploy personal websites. Today, we added and enabled WAY more themes, bringing our total supported default theme cound to 126! If you want a particular theme we don't have installed, find it on [their site](https://wordpress.org/themes/) and email [staff](mailto:staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu).
