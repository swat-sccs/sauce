For a few years, SCCS has operated a Minecraft Server for the Swarthmore community. However, server whitelisting and performance were 
tanked when we migrated to our new server last year. We are pleased to announce that once more you can whitelist your Minecraft 
account and join our server! See [Minecraft](https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/minecraft) for details. Also check out the [online 
map](https://mc.sccs.swarthmore.edu/)!
