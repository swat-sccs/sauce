# Welcome to SCCS SSH!

The Swarthmore College Computer Society welcomes you to our public SSH server.
Here, you can find free hosting utilities, tons of processing power and storage,
and more!

## Tips and Tricks

- web-docs: This folder in your home directory is a symlink that allows you to
host any static site you'd like. Your site will appear at
https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/<class>/<username>

- web-dynamic: This new addition is another symlink that drops a service onto our
Dockerized Web server, `gull`. With the proper setup, you can host a dynamic site
to any personal domain of your choice. For more info, contact us at
staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu.

- Requesting packages: Email us with package requests--this VM runs Fedora Server,
so please find the Fedora package name.

- Running in the background: Use a terminal multiplexor like `screen` or `tmux` to
run long, resource-intensive tasks without having to keep your terminal open.

Enjoy!
SCCS Staff
